# vRealize Log Insight Configuration Management and Automation Tool

This python program is built to reference values in a JSON configuration file for an individual Log
Insight Server with the option to enforce configuration compliance with the gold master being defined
in the JSON file. All this takes place over https using the Log Insight Configuration APIs. Keep in
mind that Log Insight 3.3 is the minimum version requirement as that is the version where these APIs
are available. Both Python 2 and 3 are fully supported to prevent as many headaches as possible.

A tutorial is available in the below blog posts.
